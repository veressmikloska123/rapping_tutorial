# Freestyle rapping

0. Find good royalty free (MIT license) rap background music for freestyle (aka gypsy beats)
1. Start song with yo yo yo
2. Explain yourself and your name (for example this is mister rapping god 3000, the god of rapping)
3. Say why you rap (example: and i rap for hungarian child welfare tax reduction)
4. now tell the listeners how good you are with some ryhme (while you are bad, i am a god. i am reducting you while i rock)
5. go back to your name and how no one can top you (my names mr rapping god 3000, if you want to be better than me, you will have to work all your life to even be one quarter of me)
6. rap something about your subject (hungarian child welfare tax is too high, time to reduce it like i did you, right)
7. some motivating text here and contrast listener to you (you need to work hard to achieve anything and you have bled, while i just blink and get 20 lesbian girls at my bed)
8. say some closing ryhme and end it: so you still wont go near me, chigiri migiri rap it like you owe me
